18 NoSQL: Workout Tracker
License: MIT

Description
Create the back-end of a workout tracker using a Mongo database, Mongoose schema, and routes handled via Express. Front-end code was provided.

Motivation
Learn to write CRUD using Mongoose and to deploy Heroku from a new database created in MongoDB Atlas.

Learning Targets
This exercise provided opportunities to test my budding skills with Mongo and Mongoose, and allowed further opportunities to develop pre-existing skills handling routes with Express.js. Also learned to seed a collection in a MongoDB Atlas database.
